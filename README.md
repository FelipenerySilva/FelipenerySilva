I am a data enthusiast, currently studying a Master of Data Science @ University of Newcastle, Australia.

Iâ€™m currently working on my github page to organise and present my portfolio.

Iâ€™m currently learning Python, SAP, SQL, Azure and AWS.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate in BI jobs and all aspects of data analytics and data science projects.

Iâ€™m looking for help with API, AWS, scraping and cleaning data.

Ask me about any thing you would like I best with R, Python, BI and machine learning models.
